# Breast-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction
BU-CS-581A: Biomedicine Multimodal ML Course Project

This repository contains the source code, experiments, and documentation for the "Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction" project. The goal of the project is to improve prognostic predictions for breast cancer patients by leveraging a multimodal deep learning approach. Specifically, the project integrates imaging and clinical data using a joint fusion strategy: a CNN (built on a ResNet framework) processes DICOM breast MRI images, while an RNN (using LSTM/GRU) handles clinical data. The features extracted from both modalities are combined via a fusion layer to predict patient outcomes. This work serves as a reference implementation for utilizing multimodal fusion techniques in medical applications, aiming to enhance accuracy and support precision oncology.
